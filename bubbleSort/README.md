Bubble sort algorithm:
_______________________________________________________________________

Demonstration of a bubble sorting algorythm.
It is based on comparing values of two numbers in a pair.
In one cycle it compares two values of every pair in a list and changes
their position in the pair. Smaller number to left and bigger number to 
right.
After all big numbers are on right site of the list and no more 
replacing in pairs happened sorting is done.
Similar like big bubbles raising in lemonade to it's level.
